 **Login**: *guest* | **Password**: *password*

##  üßê  Motivation & Challenges

---

> My major motivation with the backend was to learn about test-driven development, coverage, and error handling. TTD was extremely tedious to start, but I grew appreciate how it forces the developer write thoughtful code based on initial design. I'd imagine it would become smoother of a process as experience grows.
>
> I also found raw SQL queries to be quite challenging at first, but slowly adapted, and learned to like the control given when you do not use an ORM.

##  üíª  **Tech Stack** & *Packages*

  **Node.js | Express | SQL | Postgres | Jest**

 *bcrypt | colors | cors | dotenv | jsonschema | jsonwebtoken | morgan | pg*

Here is a high level overview of a few of the features:
- RESTful API built with Node.js and Express
- 95% test coverage for backend data using Jest
- No ORM, raw SQL queries
- Handled authorization and authentication by utilizing middleware with jsonwebtoken and password encryption with BCrypt
