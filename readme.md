 **Login**: *guest* | **Password**: *password*

##  🧐  Motivation & Challenges

---

> My major motivation with the backend was to learn about test-driven development, coverage, and error handling. TTD was extremely tedious to start, but I grew appreciate how it forces the developer write thoughtful code based on initial design. I'd imagine it would become smoother of a process as experience grows.
>
> I also found raw SQL queries to be quite challenging at first, but slowly adapted, and learned to like the control given when you do not use an ORM.
